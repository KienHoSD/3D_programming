Paul Heckbert's ray tracing algorithm.

## Description

This is the ray tracing algorithm that Paul Heckbert obfuscated. The code is written in C and is really hard to understand. The code is not mine, it is Paul Heckbert's. I just uploaded it to GitHub so that I can share it with others.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to have a C/C++ compiler installed on your computer.

## Usage

To run the code, you need to have a C compiler installed on your computer. You can compile the code using the following command:

```bash
g++ minray.cpp -o minray
```

After compiling the code, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
./minray >> minray.ppm
```

The code will generate an image file called `minray.ppm` which you can view using an image viewer.
